	NOTE, if the "Android Studio project" previously has been a local repository, 
	the first thing to do is to remove the ".git" map, the ".gitattributes" and ".gitignore" files (if they exist).

	GitHub DeskTop
	
		-> File -> New repository...
			Name = "preference"
			Description = "a library of custom android preferences"
			Local path = "D:\Sandbox\AndroidStudioProjects"
			Initialize this repository with a README = "unchecked"
			Git ignore = "Android" (from the drop-down menu)
			Licence = "None"
			
		-> Click on Create repository
			
		-> Click on Publish repository -> Click on Publish repository
	
- Releases:

	GitHub Desktop allows you to create annotated tags. Tags are associated with commits, so you can use a tag 
	to mark an individual point in your repository's history, including a version number for a release.

	GitHub Desktop 
	
		-> In the left sidebar, click History
		
		-> 	Right click on the "Initial commit"
		
			Chose Create Tag...
				Name = "the version number in build.gradle"
				
				->	Click on Create tag
				
			GitHub Desktop displays an arrow  if the tag has not been pushed to the remote repository

		-> In the left sidebar, click Changes
			
		-> Click on Commit...
		
		-> Click on Push origin on the "second top bar"
